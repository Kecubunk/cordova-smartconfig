# Cordova Smartconfig
This is an attempt to make the Texas Instruments SmartConfig for CC3000/CC3200 interface with Cordova.


## WARNING

This code is NOT production ready. **DO NOT USE SMARTCONFIG**

1. The code here is not properly abstracted into plugin worthy code. It is close but the work was not completed. The branch that has the refactoring is here: https://github.com/IdeaCouture/cordova-smartconfig/tree/creating_module
2. The SmartConfig process does not work for all mobile devices. See this post from Texas Instruments http://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless_connectivity/f/968/p/384654/1357939#1357939 There is a known bug that may be fixed in the future.
